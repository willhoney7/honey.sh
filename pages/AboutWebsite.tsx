					This is the <strong>fourth</strong> iteration of my personal website.

				<ul>
					<li>
						The first version (~2010) was built on Wordpress with a theme by{' '}
						<a

						>
							Elegant Themes
						</a>
						.
					</li>

						The second iteration (2012) was written with{' '}
						<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
							Jekyll
						</a>{' '}
						and hosted on Github Pages. I had grand plans of blogging but never followed
						through.
					</li>
					<li>
						For the third version (2018), I made a basic site with{' '}
						<a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">
							Gatsby
						</a>{' '}
						but found it too much work to get simple things done and never really did
						anything with it.
					</li>
					<li>
						This fourth version, shipped in 2020, is built with{' '}
						<a href="https://nextjs.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">
							Next.js
						</a>{' '}
						with a lightly modified starter template ðŸ˜±. Is this the time I actually
						invest in this website? Who knows... not me!
